# DSA-Project-Visualization

This repository is for my Data Structure and Algorithm project. Our goal is to make a visualization program for diferent sorting algorithm and Dijkstra Algorithm.

## resource
* Background images
* Fonts

## bin
* **.dll** files

## include
* **cScreen.hpp** - for managing and running all screens
* **screens.hpp** - for including all screens
* **menu.hpp** - *home* screen
* **Dijkstra.hpp** - *Dijkstra Algorithm* to find shortest distance between two coordinates
* **Quick.hpp** - *Quick Sort* and *Bubble Sort* algorithm visualization
* **credits.hpp** - show the credits and information of contributers or project member

## src
* **main.cpp** - Manages all screens--file which runs first
* **menu.cpp** - *home* screen
* **Dijkstra.cpp** - *Dijkstra Algorithm* to find shortest distance between two coordinates
* **Quick.cpp** - *Quick Sort* and *Bubble Sort* algorithm visualization
* **credits.cpp** - show the credits and information of contributers or project member

# Enjoy coding!!!
